# Mix-Soup-Game
This C program, titled "Character Soup", is an interactive text-based game where players compete against a computer to match randomly generated sequences of characters, referred to as "soups." The game offers three distinct modes: Mixed Soup, which includes random printable ASCII characters; Alphabet Soup, consisting of uppercase and lowercase alphabetic characters; and Number Soup, featuring numeric digits (0â€“9). Players begin by entering their names, which are validated to ensure they contain only alphabetic characters and are within 25 characters in length. The game proceeds through 10 rounds, generating new soups for each round, and evaluates character matches between the player's soup and the game's soup to calculate scores. Points are awarded based on exact character matches, with additional bonuses for multiple matches within a round. At the end of the 10 rounds, total scores are compared to declare the winner or determine a tie. The program includes several functions to handle key tasks such as displaying menus, validating input, generating soups for each mode, resetting soups, calculating scores, and printing ASCII values of characters. This structured approach makes the game engaging while showcasing key programming techniques, including string manipulation, input validation, and random number generation.
